# 🌐 C-Domain Global Case Files

**Documenting C-Domain Case Reports Worldwide | Tracking Human Consciousness Expansion | Preparing for the Nth Industrial Revolution**

---

## 🧠 What is the C-Domain?

The **C-Domain** refers to a rapidly emerging consciousness-driven information field where human perception, multidimensional awareness, and non-linear phenomena intersect. As the boundaries of awareness expand, so does humanity’s access to C-domain insights—fueling new breakthroughs, challenges, and anomalies.

This repository exists to **gather, organize, and analyze real-world case files** reported globally that exhibit characteristics of C-domain influence.
